brief: Ampehre v0.8.0 with a new client server implementation, allowing even more precise measurements

#### Description:

Ampehre, v0.8.0 is now available at our github repository [github.com/akiml/ampehre](https://github.com/akiml/ampehre).

---

#### Feature improvements:

 
This is a client/server implementation. The Graphical User Interface can now be started on any other machine (client), which receives the necessary data from the heterogeneous node (server) via network. This prevents the node from rendering plots itself and thus reduces power consumption, lowers the total usage and reduces the component's temperature. This structure leads to a reduction of distortion. The plots and settings allow a higher level of configuration, which makes MSMonitor more customizable. Personal settings can be exported and imported, in order to facilitate a possible client change.
